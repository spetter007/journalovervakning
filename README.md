This repository was brought to life to help organizations quickly (without relying on pre-built add-ons!) get started with using **Splunk Enterprise/Cloud** to protect **patient privacy**. The idea is to get as close as possible to a copy-and-paste approach, allowing you to select and deploy  the most relevant content based on your specific needs and requirements.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

### Data Guide
bla bla bla 

### 🔍 Use Cases
This repo contains **use cases** that work together to surface incidents that potentially could indicate a violation of patient privacy. The use cases fall into the following two categories:

#### **Anomaly-Triggering**
- Identifies **unusual behavior** by searching and correlating logs/events to trigger anomalies.
- Surfaces activity that may be abnormal but does not, on its own, clearly indicate a privacy violation.

#### **Incident-Triggering**
- Correlates and **groups anomalies together** to trigger incidents.
- Connects patterns of unusual behavior over time, helping to identify potential policy violations.

### 📊 Dashboards
- Prebuilt **Splunk dashboards** for visualizing anomalies and incidents.
- Helps organisations **investigate** potential privacy violations.
