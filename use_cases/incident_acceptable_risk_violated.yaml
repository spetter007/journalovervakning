name: acceptable risk violated
type: incident-triggering
prerequisites: 
- indexes: 
          anomaly_collection (explanation: an index where identified anomalies are stored as events)
          incident_collection (explanation: an index where identified incidents are stored as events)
- lookups: 
- macros: 
          pda_indexes (explanation: references the indexes where patient privacy act associated logs and events are stored)
          pda_sourcetypes (explanation: references the sourcetypes assigned to patient privacy act associated logs and events)
          pda_sources (explanation: references the sources assigned to patient privacy act associated logs and events)
- fields: 
- searches: 
          search 1
how_to_implement:
          1. create an index called 'anomaly_collection'.
          2. create a KVstore lookup called 'baseline_working_hours', which should include the fields .
          3. create the field extractions for
          4. create the macros 'pda_indexes', 'pda_sourcetypes', and 'pda_sources'. Have them refer to the indexes, sourcetypes and sources that are used by the logs and events that fall under the Patient Data Act - this ensures that when the macros are referenced in a search, Splunk will retreive the right data. 
          5. create 'search 1'
