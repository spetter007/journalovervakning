name: acceptable risk violated
type: incident-triggering
prerequisites: 
- indexes: 
          anomaly_collection (explanation: an index where identified anomalies are stored as events)
          incident_collection (explanation: an index where identified incidents are stored as events)
- lookups: 
- macros: 
- fields: 
          risk_score
          staff_ID
          patient_ID
- searches: 
          search 1
how_to_implement:
          1. create an index called 'anomaly_collection' and 'incident_collection'.
          4. create the macros 'pda_indexes', 'pda_sourcetypes', and 'pda_sources'. Have them refer to the indexes, sourcetypes and sources that are used by the logs and events that fall under the Patient Data Act - this ensures that when the macros are referenced in a search, Splunk will retreive the right data. 
          5. create 'search 1'
