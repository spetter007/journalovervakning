name: first time interaction
type: anomaly-triggering
use_case_ID: uc1
purpose: this use case aims to identify employees who recently interacted with a patient without having any prior history of interaction in the last 6 months. 
prerequisites: 
- data_sources: 
          any data source that includes information about interactions between employees and patients. 
- indexes: 
          anomaly_collection (explanation: an index where identified anomalies are stored as events)
- lookups: 
          baseline_historical_interaction (explanation: a lookup file that stores information about when employees and patients last have interacted)
- macros: 
          pda_indexes (explanation: references the indexes where patient data act associated logs and events are stored)
          pda_sourcetypes (explanation: references the sourcetypes assigned to patient data act associated logs and events)
          pda_sources (explanation: references the sources assigned to patient data act associated logs and events)
- fields: 
          staff_ID (explanation: a unique identifier for the employee)
          patient_ID (explanation: a unique identifier for the patient)
          care_provider_ID (explanation: a unique identifier for the care provider)
          care_unit_ID (explanation: a unique identifier for care unit at the care provider)
- searches: 
          search 1
          search 2
          search 3
how_to_implement (note: everything is case sensitive, and the steps 1-5 should be executed in a sequential order):
          1. create an index called 'anomaly_collection'.
          2. import the lookup 'baseline_historical_interaction' (https://github.com/spettersson/splunk4patientprivacy/blob/cc1ba2159eadc166eee0226790126da16d50f608/lookups/baseline_historical_baseline.csv). Make use of the Splunk app 'Splunk App for Lookup File Editing' (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724).
          3. create the field extractions and field aliases for staff_ID and patient_ID, ensuring that each data source has a unique extraction to prevent field name collisions. For example, if dealing with Cambio COSMIC logs, extract the field as cosmic_staff_ID and then create a field alias (cosmic_staff_ID AS staff_ID) to normalize it. This approach allows multiple data sources to maintain unique field extractions while enabling searches using a common field name (staff_ID).
          4. create the macros 'pda_indexes', 'pda_sourcetypes', and 'pda_sources'. Have them refer to the indexes, sourcetypes and sources that are used by the logs and events that fall under the Patient Data Act - this ensures that when the macros are referenced in a search, Splunk will retreive the right data. 
          5. create 'search 1', followed by 'search 2', followed by 'search 3'.
search 1: 
- description: establishes a baseline of historical interaction for the past 6 months.
- search: 
          `pda_indexes` `pda_sourcetypes` `pda_sources` earliest=-6mon
          | fields _time, staff_ID, patient_ID
          | stats latest(_time) as last_interaction by staff_ID, patient_ID
          | table staff_ID, patient_ID, last_interaction
          | outputlookup baseline_historical_interaction
- time range picker: the time range for search 1 is explicitly defined within the search using the earliest option (earliest=-6mon). By default, the search processes data from current time to 6 month ago (with the possiblity to adjust to specific needs/requirements).
- cron schedule: N/A (run only once in the search bar).
search 2: 
- description: incrementally updates the historical interaction on a daily basis.
- search:
          | inputlookup baseline_historical_interaction
          | append [

                    | stats latest(_time) as last_interaction by staff_ID, patient_ID
                    | table staff_ID, patient_ID, last_interaction
                   ]
          | stats max(last_interaction) as last_interaction by staff_ID, patient_ID
          | table staff_ID, patient_ID, last_interaction
          | outputlookup baseline_historical_interaction
- time range picker: the time range for search 2 is explicitly defined in the search using the earliest and latest options (earliest=-1d@d and latest=@d). By default, the search processes data from the entire previous day (midnight to midnight).
- cron schedule: 0 0 * * * (scheduled to run every day of the week at midnight).
search 3:
- description: identifies employees who have interacted with a patient within the past 10-minute window (accounting for a 2-minute latency) but have not had any prior contact with the same patient in the last 6 months. For every single match, an anomaly is triggered and stored in the anomaly_collection index as an event for further correlation and analytics.

- time range picker: the time range for search 3 is explicitly defined within the search using the earliest and latest options (earliest=-12min@min and latest=-2min@min). By default, the search processes data from 12 minutes ago up to 2 minutes ago (with the possiblity to adjust to specific needs/requirements), ensuring a consistent 10-minute window that accounts for potential data latency.
- cron schedule: */10 * * * * (scheduled to run every 10th minute of every hour, 24/7, across all days of the week).
