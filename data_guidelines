      - Event types categorize events within a data source, making it easier to filter and retrieve relevant events in searches.
      - Instead of referencing multiple event types (that fall within the same category) one by one in a search, a single common denominator
        (the tag 'journal') can be referenced instead to efficiently retrieve all relevant events.
      - Event types can be created via:
          - Splunk Web: Settings > Event Types > New Event Type
            - If you create an event type in Splunk Web and reference a tag that does not already exist, Splunk automatically creates that tag.
          - Configuration files: eventtypes.conf and tags.conf.
            - If you define event types in configuration files that references a tag, you must manually define that tag in tags.conf.
      - Each eventtype needs three pieces of information:
          - A unique name
          - A search string that identifies the relevant events from the specific journal system.
              - The search should reference the index, host, source, and sourcetype fields with their appropriate values.
              - Depending on the journal system, additional field-value pairs and search terms may be required to ensure precise event categorization.
          - A reference to the tag 'journal'.
